        <strong>Accela, Inc.</strong> <i>April 2021 - present</i>

      <p>
        I work to diagnose issues with Accela’s software products. I interact
        with Accela’s clients to detail replication steps of the problem at hand
        and find a resolution to it if I can’t diagnose it as a software glitch.
        I specialized in diagnosing issues with the company’s main mobile
        application, which involved utilizing our API using Postman to decipher
        where errors come from in the mobile app using Trace IDs provided in the
        API call’s response.
